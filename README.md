Economic Load Dispatch using Genetic Algorithm
Every generator in power system has some constraints attached to its operation. To supply the power demand the genrators are needed to operate in most cost efficient way.


Our system has three generators with minimum and maximum power constraints.

Cost equation of generation-

C1 = a1*Pg1^2 + b1*Pg1 + c1

C2 = a2*Pg2^2 + b2*Pg2 + c2

C3 = a3*Pg3^2 + b3*Pg3 + c3



pop_data = [chromosome 1-12] [dec_value 13] [fitness 14] [error 15] [cost 16] [prob 17] [roul_wheel_start 18] [roul_wheel_end 19]
