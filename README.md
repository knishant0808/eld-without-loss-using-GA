Economic Load Dispatch using Genetic Algorithm
Every generator in power system has some constraints attached to its operation. To supply the power demand the genrators are needed to operate in most cost efficient way.


Our system has three generators with minimum and maximum power constraints.

Cost equation of generation-

C1 = a1*Pg1^2 + b1*Pg1 + c1

C2 = a2*Pg2^2 + b2*Pg2 + c2

C3 = a3*Pg3^2 + b3*Pg3 + c3
